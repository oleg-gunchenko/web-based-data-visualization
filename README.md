# Financial web graph

**Bokeh** is a data visualization library in **Python** that provides high-performance interactive charts and plots. Bokeh output can be obtained in various mediums like notebook, html and server. It is possible to embed bokeh plots in Django and flask apps.

Here, I have deployed it on [my website](https://web-app-pt.herokuapp.com/) using flask, it was cool right!? :world_map:

The graph which is plotted in this financial web graph is called as *candlestick chart*

A **candlestick chart** (also called Japanese candlestick chart) is a style of financial chart used to describe price movements of a security, derivative, or currency. Each "candlestick" typically shows one day, thus a one-month chart may show the 20 trading days as 20 candlesticks.
